This is a repository for W200 Fall 2018, Project 2.

Team members: Jonathan Hilton, Thanh Le, Eddie Zhu.

For this project, our team decided to analyze the correlations and potential cause / effect relationship of the variables between Chicago crimes data with Chicago traffic violations data and Chicago demographic data. 

We have agreed to share the content within this Repo with UCB MIDS program, for educational purpose only, not to be distributed or use for any other purpose.  Thank you.
